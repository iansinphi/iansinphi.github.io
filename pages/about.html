			<h3>Ever since I was a kid,</h3>
			<p>I could remember staring into voids. Needle eyed, narrow minded, observations of the space between branch and leaf.</p>
			<p>Raised as an actor, I admired the recital of written word. In the periods between, I would read and write. I found independence in songs, liberating ugly phrases from chains. All in all, I admire transformation.</p>
			<p>As a developer, I strive to take advantage of the ordinary and make it truly yours.</p>
			<p>Waking every morning, I peer into these unloved spaces and insert art. Between letters, I aspire to create.</p>
